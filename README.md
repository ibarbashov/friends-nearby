# Contributing
- Each feature should be worked on in a separate branch. Branch name must match the backlog entry (e.g. ```#8_Initialize_Spring_Boot_Project``` for ![Issue #8](https://github.com/iodudes/friends-nearby/issues/8))
- Try to make atomic commits (i.e. avoid changing files unrelated to your feature or working on several feature at a time). 
- Commit message should include Issue # followed by dash and short explanation in Present Simple (e. g. ```#8 - Disable SpringBoot banner```)
- After feature is completed feel free to open pull request (PR) into ```master``` and ask someone for a review.
- DO NOT EVER merge your own PR!
